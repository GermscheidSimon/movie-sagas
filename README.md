# Movie Sagas Project


## Description
__Duration: weekend Assignemnt

Movies Sagas is a project focussed on applying lessons learned on Redux, and Redux Sagas. This project also require the use of relational SQL tables making routing for Express more tricky. 
This project was a lot of fun to put together, and I focused a lot on making the page look like a real site. I learned a lot about how Sags work, and interact with the client.
